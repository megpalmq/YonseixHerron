    Over the past decade, extensive discussions have centered on the United
    Nations and its Sustainable Development Goals, ranging from No Poverty, and
    Zero Hunger to Good Health and Well-Being. <br />
    <br />
    However, how do these goals impact individuals at a local level? What role
    can designers play in communicating this information eGectively?
    Additionally, how are we collaborating with communities to ensure that our
    designs align with the needs and aspirations of both organizations and
    residents?

      In the United States, communities grappling with systemic inequities
      disproportionately aGect older adults, particularly concerning food
      insecurity. Nationally, food insecurity is a significant concern, with the
      state of Indiana exhibiting even higher rates of this issue. A design
      study was undertaken at a reputable educational institution dedicated to
      community engagement and the advancement of sustainable development in
      Indianapolis, Indiana, investigating the multifaceted challenges
      encountered by older adults. The research investigates essential aspects,
      including dietary requirements, the existence of food deserts, challenges
      related to mobility and accessibility, and the impact of social services
      on the mental and social well-being of older adults. The goal is to
      pinpoint eGective modifications in food systems and support frameworks to
      improve their overall quality of life.

      Today, designers are pivotal in oGering perspectives to address these
      intricate challenges through socio-cultural reimagining and compassionate
      collaboration with stakeholders. Shifting from an absence-centered
      approach, the study explores creative methods for communicating the
      experiences of food insecurity and the relationship between mental
      well-being and food access. <br><br>Thereby, employing comparative research and
      design solutions aimed at improving communication about food serenity for
      the elderly in Indianapolis. A critical aspect of the study emphasizes the
      authors' pedagogical approach within the undergraduate Visual
      Communication Design curriculum, and how this design project was developed
      and facilitated within a virtual global exchange with students from South
      Korea in a studio classroom environment.<br> <br> The results will be presented in
      a poster that highlights community engagement strategies with project
      partners, customized design research approaches, and frameworks for
      evaluating both immediate and long-term eGects on the community
