        As seniors age, the body requires specific nutrients to support bone health, muscle function, immune system strength, and energy levels. A well-balanced diet that addresses these needs can significantly improve the quality of life for elderly individuals.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Research & Discovery:</strong>We started by gathering detailed information on the specific nutritional needs of elderly individuals. This included understanding the importance of high-fiber foods, lean proteins, healthy fats, and calcium-rich options that support bone health. We also focused on understanding how activity levels affect caloric intake and how to adjust diets accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Concept Development:</strong> <br>With the research in hand, we created concepts for an easily digestible, visually clear brochure layout. The design focused on breaking down complex nutritional information into simple, user-friendly sections, incorporating helpful tips on portion control, daily vitamin and mineral intake, and adjusting diets for lower activity levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prototype Testing:</strong> For the prototype testing phase, we focused on creating a nostalgic experience that resonated with the elderly audience. We introduced elements inspired by classic diner menus to evoke a sense of familiarity and comfort. Participants interacted with the brochure, providing feedback on how the diner-style design made them feel connected to the content. Testing emphasized clarity, ease of reading, and the effectiveness of visual cues, such as retro typography and iconography, which were designed to enhance engagement. Based on feedback, we adjusted font sizes, color contrasts, and imagery to make the final version both visually appealing and easy to navigate for older users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Final Solution:</strong> The final brochure design presents an easy-to-follow nutrition guide, with clear visuals, simple text, and a focus on essential nutrients. It includes a section on portion control, a balanced meal plan for the day, and guidance on daily vitamin and mineral requirements, making it a valuable resource for seniors.
