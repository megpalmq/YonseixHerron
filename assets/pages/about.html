    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        Yonsei University and Herron School of Art + Design students unite to
        create impactful designs addressing food scarcity and health challenges
        for elderly communities in Korea and Indianapolis. Each team was
        assigned a distinct topic and presentation style, using visuals,
        typography, and layout to communicate the message effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        This collaboration was a valuable opportunity for students to learn from
        one another, explore diverse design techniques, and gain hands-on
        experience in addressing critical social issues through creative
        storytelling.

      Food insecurity affects vulnerable populations across Indiana and Korea,
      particularly the elderly and underserved communities. By focusing on these
      regions, our collaboration highlights the importance of addressing food
      access disparities and fostering community-driven solutions.
