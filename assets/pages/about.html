        <h2>Indiana</h2>
        <div class="text-content"></div>
        <p>
          Food insecurity is a pressing issue affecting many residents of
          Indiana, particularly in rural and urban areas. Despite the state's
          agricultural wealth, a significant number of Hoosiers face challenges
          in accessing nutritious, affordable food.
          <br />
          This issue is often exacerbated by high poverty rates, unemployment,
          and a lack of access to food retailers in certain regions, resulting
          in food deserts. The elderly population is especially vulnerable, with
          many facing difficulties in obtaining fresh produce, largely due to
          limited mobility and fixed incomes. In cities like Indianapolis, Fort
          Wayne, and Evansville, low-income households struggle to meet basic
          nutritional needs, leading to poor health outcomes and increased
          reliance on food pantries and community food banks.<br />

          Furthermore, food insecurity in Indiana has a significant ripple
          effect, impacting children's education, physical and mental
          development, and contributing to the cycle of poverty.
        </p>
       

        <h2>South Korea</h2>
        <p>
          In South Korea, food insecurity, while less talked about, is becoming
          an increasing concern, especially for vulnerable groups like the
          elderly and low-income families. Despite the country’s high-tech,
          modern economy, many individuals, particularly seniors, face
          difficulties in accessing nutritious meals due to rising food costs
          and limited availability of affordable food in certain areas. Food
          insecurity in Korea is also linked to the country’s aging population,
          as older adults, often living alone or in poverty, have limited access
          to fresh food and adequate nutrition. Seoul and other major cities,
          such as Busan, have seen increased reports of elderly individuals
          experiencing malnutrition due to economic hardship. Furthermore, food
          banks and social welfare programs in Korea are often underfunded,
          leaving many citizens without the support they need. The issue is
          compounded by societal pressures that often stigmatize those who rely
          on these services, further isolating and disenfranchising vulnerable
          groups.

    <p>
      Food insecurity affects vulnerable populations across Indiana and Korea,
      particularly the elderly and underserved communities. By focusing on these
      regions, our collaboration highlights the importance of addressing food
      access disparities and fostering community-driven solutions.

    <div class="about-content">
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>
          Yonsei University and Herron School of Art + Design students united to
          create impactful designs addressing food scarcity and health
          challenges for elderly communities in Korea and Indianapolis. Each
          team was assigned a distinct topic and presentation style, using
          visuals, typography, and layout to communicate the message
          effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          This collaboration was a valuable opportunity for students to learn
          from one another, explore diverse design techniques, and gain hands-on
          experience in addressing critical social issues through creative
          storytelling.
